##### Main features worked on

1. `Budget` class:
    1. These budgets serve as the main building block the app, as expenses created by the user can be linked to
       these budgets. The statistics of each budget can then be tracked and visualised to better show the user if they
       are
       hitting
       their budget targets.


2. Accompanying budget classes, such as the BudgetParser, BudgetCommand and BudgetUIResponse classes


3. Implementation of the visual bars and underlying logic used in the budget-related output of the `stats` command and
   the addition of color to the bars when a budget is
   exceeded


4. Assist in the skeleton code and brainstorming new ideas for features to include for our app


5. Testing of budget commands and fixing of app bugs

6. Creation of Budget Buddy logo

#### Contributions to the User Guide

1. I added the instructions for the `Budgets` class commands, showing its related classes and how commands such as
   `budget add`, `budget set` and `budget del` commands are used and explain its intended usage.


2. I assisted in the creation of the `help` command and explained the use of the help command in the user guide to
   better
   educate new users on how to use our app.


3. I assisted in the introduction and explanation of the overall idea of the app and the explanation of its intended
   use,
   as well as how the data will be saved and exported.

#### Contributions to the Developer Guide

1. I added the documentation for the `BudgetCommand` class commands, showing its related classes and how commands such
   as
   `budget add`, `budget set` and `budget del` commands are implemented together with its related classes.
   I also helped to initiate the creation of the `help` command to create a better experience for new users who are not
   aware of the commands to use the Budget Buddy app.


2. I added, edited and maintained the sequence diagram for the `BudgetCommand` class, to show how inputs related to the
   budget command are parsed and processed and how budget commands are executed.


3. I added, edited and maintained the sequence diagram for the `CommandParser` class to show how user inputs are parsed
   and
   classified into the different possible function inputs Budget Buddy accepts, and how the information is passed onto
   the related
   command parser for the different inputs.

#### Contributions to team-based tasks

1. I helped to initiate and push members to finish their tasks on time so as to not delay the development of our app.
2. I helped in maintaining the Github issues page when there were a lot of new issues.
