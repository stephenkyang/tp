##### Main features worked on

1. `Deposit` class: The deposit class is the implementation of the deposit feature in Budget Buddy. It serves as a core component where
    users can log all their deposits and find how much money they've saved.

2. The backend implmentation of deposit classes, such as the DepositParser, DepositClass and DepositUIResponse classes


3. Assist in the skeleton code and brainstorming new ideas for features to include for our app


4. Testing of deposit commands and fixing bugs relating to the deposit class.

#### Contributions to the User Guide

1. I added the instructions for the `Deposit` class commands, showing its related classes and how commands such as
   `deposit add`, `deposit find`, `depsoit clear` and `deposit list` commands are used and explain its intended usage.

#### Contributions to the Developer Guide

1. I added the documentation for the `DepositCommand` class commands, showing its related classes and how commands such
   as
   `deposit add`, `deposit find`, `depsoit clear` and `deposit list` commands are implemented together with its related classes.
   I also helped to initiate the creation of the `deposit help` command to create a better experience for new users who are not
   aware of the commands to use the Budget Buddy app.


2. I added, edited and maintained the sequence diagram for the `DepositCommand` class, to show how inputs related to the
   deposit command are parsed and processed and how deposit commands are executed.


3. I added, edited and maintained the sequence diagram for the `CommandParser` class to show how user inputs are parsed
   and
   classified into the different possible function inputs Budget Buddy accepts, and how the information is passed onto
   the related
   command parser for the different inputs.

#### Contributions to team-based tasks

1. I took initiative in assigning myself issues that did not pertain to my specific portion of the project to
   finish the project by deadline.
2. I created issues in the Github repo for problems that I saw.
